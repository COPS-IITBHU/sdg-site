          Development, or Cloud Development, we manufacture all units here!
          Along the lines of development, we enjoy discussions and
          collaborations too. Regular DevTalks for discussions and doubts about
          new tech and associating over Open Source provides us with great
          opportunities of expanding our colossal network. Multiverse of

          Our motto is constantly learning and revamping. Hackalog, our very own
          portal for maintaining logs of our Hackathon, helps us archive
          hackathon details and leaderboards. Lite Hai, our institute's app, is
          every student's guide to various student bodies, fests, workshops; and
          it also comes with Google Maps for easy movement within the campus.
          Our official website for the Software Development Group is a
          storehouse for various software development blogs and our achievements
          and projects. Our insatiable appetite towards developing adores
          creating Telegram Bots would be fair to say.
