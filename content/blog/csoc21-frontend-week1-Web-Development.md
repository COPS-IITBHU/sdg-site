# Introduction

Web development is a basic skill that is often said as a good start to the development field. This week you will learn the basics of web development. You will get familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On completion, you will be able to make simple static websites for both desktop and mobile.

## CSS Frameworks

Youâ€™ve spent plenty of time building up a great base of knowledge of HTML and CSS and even design. But itâ€™s still a pain in the butt to lay out everything manually and keep repeating yourself all the time when writing your code. If only there was a way to save yourself all kinds of effortâ€¦

Frameworks to the rescue! Frameworks let you focus more on building great sites and less on how they are actually coded up on the front end. They are great for learning and great for rapidly producing sites.

# Challenge

As an aspiring developer, you'd need to keep building things to keep your knowledge on tips. Now that you are good to go with the basics of Web Development, we want you to build **one of the games** from the following list on your own.

1. Tic-Tac-Toe Game
2. Sudoku game

You have to provide your Repo and Deployed URL as part of submission

### **Rules**

- The project must contain three filesÂ `index.html`,Â `main.js`,Â `style.css`,Â and other static files like images only. Though to make code more readable, you may split the code into multiple files.
- Using plagiarised code or readymade templates will lead to a penalty on your score. We can easily recognize it ;)

### **Judging**

The evaluation would be done mainly on the following basis:

1. User Interface and User Experience
2. Authenticity and readability of the code
3. Completion of mentioned tasks
4. Bonus Points for implementing extra features depending on your creativityðŸ˜‰

Remember, the deadline for this week's task is **June 13th, 2021, 23:59**.

## Tic Tac Toe

**Objective:** You need to build a Tic Tac Toe game

**Tasks:-**

- **Task 1**: Implement a two-player mode that allows two people to compete against each other.
- **Task 2**: Add a single-player mode that allows users to play with an intelligent bot that never loses.
- **Task 3**: Add an option to select which shape to begin with (X/O).
- **Task 4:** In single-player mode, add an option to choose who will start first - computer or player.
- **Extras:** You may keep a record of scores and use player names for interactivity.

## Sudoku

**Objective:** You need to build a Sudoku board game.

**Tasks:-**

- **Task 1**: Implement a Sudoku game. (The board may remain the same every time).
- **Task 2**: Implement a board generator and generate a random board in every game. You may use backtracking or naive approaches to generate the board.
- **Task 3:** Add a timer to the game, where the user may select a particular time to complete the game within it. **Bonus**: As the time reaches 0, the user can be warned about the time running out.
- **Task 4:** Warning the user about incorrect inputs and user engagement.
- **Extras:** To make the game more engaging, you may provide hints if the user is stuck for like 10-20 seconds.
