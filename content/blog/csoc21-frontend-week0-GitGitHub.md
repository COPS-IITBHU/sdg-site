# Git and GitHub

Due Date: June 6, 2021
type: Mandatory

# Introduction

Git is a prevalent version control system (VCS) used in Open Source Development. It is a crucial skill to learn while developing in a team. 

GitHub is a web-based service for version control using Git. It is a social networking site for developers, where you can look at other people's code, identify issues and even propose changes.

## Using GUI for Version Control

Usually, when programmers use Git for version control of their code, they use the command-line user interface, i.e., a terminal interface from a UNIX/Linux OS. However, several tools enable Git easily for novices using a Graphical User Interface (GUI), enabling a point-and-click interface. Two great tools for GUIs are GitHub Desktop and Git extension in Visual Studio Code.

# Practice and Tasks

Now that you are comfortable with the version control systems, we want you to try out some challenges to check you're on the right track.

Remember, deadline for both the tasks is **June 6th, 2021 23:59.**

## First Challenge

In this challenge, you need to fork the following project into your GitHub account, clone it to your system, create your new branch, make necessary changes to include your name card. After editing, commit your changes and push them to origin after pulling any possible changes made. Open a pull request when all looks good for review.

Fork from and Open your pull requests here for the first challenge

## Second Challenge

In this challenge, you need to implement any one algorithm on your own from the given list of algorithms. Different algorithms carry different points, and your net points accumulated will be calculated. 

As done in the first challenge, you'll fork the repository and submit pull requests from your newly created branch for this challenge here.
