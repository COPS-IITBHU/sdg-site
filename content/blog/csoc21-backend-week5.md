# Week 5

Now that you have completed the CSOC Backend Assignment, you built your own web app backed with Django/Express as the backend. Overnight your web app became a star success!! Congrats! They love it so much, that they want a mobile phone version! Time to create an Android Version! And an iOS version...

And then you have to replicate 2 times the same backend code to Add, View, Remove, Update and Delete data, with different languages.

That opens the door to many possible mistakesâ€¦ And that is where rest APIs shines out.....

Djnago Rest Framework (DRF) and Express enable you to host the same backend for web, mobile and desktop applications.

Needless to say, we have so lovingly prepared an assignment for you that will make you "REST-less" (pun intended :)) 

You may choose to compete in any number of tracks.
