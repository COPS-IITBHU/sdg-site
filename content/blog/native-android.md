The aptest definition for android is - "Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets."

Evident enough that the software engineering field for developing such apps is known as Android App Development.

Most of the applications are free to download and are also easily available on the play store in comparison to another operating system.
