# Week 0

Consider this week as "revision of the fundamentals" since most have already cleared some or all of the topics of this week. If you think you're weak in any of the topics below or haven't finished even one of the tasks listed, then make sure to finish them now.

Throughout this course, we would require Linux to do assignments and resources will be posted for the same OS. It's expected that most have their Linux system ready due to COPS Linux Installation fest, but no worries! We're sharing all the required resources to get your system in shape for the following weeks and the basic shell commands you need to master.

This week will be critical for the beginners to learn to work productively on their software projects and also to learn the art of asking questions the “hacker’s way”.

We've also covered Git and [GitHub](https://github.com/) earlier, during the Dev-OSS workshops, so make sure to revise it well!

There's a basic web dev project too to finish by the end of this week (June 6), so get your HTML tools back in shape!
