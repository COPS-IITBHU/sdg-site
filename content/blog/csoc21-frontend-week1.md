# Week 1

This week, we'll jump with the basics of development with three tracks -

1. Android Development
2. Web Development
3. Cross Platform Development using Flutter

Having knowledge of the previous week is necessary since Git remains highly used in this week. If you think you're weak in any of the topics, then try to revise them.

There's a basic project in each track as well to finish by the end of this week (June 13), so get your tools back in shape!

You may choose to compete in any number of tracks.
