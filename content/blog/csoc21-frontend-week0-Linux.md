# Linux

# Introduction

Surely you’ve all heard of Linux before; after all, it’s one of the tech buzzwords. But, let’s clarify that we use the word “Linux” here to refer to Linux as a distribution, which technically provides the full OS functionality.

Linux has become the de facto OS of programmers worldwide, and so you all must get comfortable with it. Out of the variety of Linux distributions ( aka distros ) available in the market (i.e. FOSS market), Ubuntu or any Debian based Linux Distro is the most common and most natural to set up.

The reason that most programmers prefer to use Linux Based OS because it is open source and hence the associated reliability and security. Alongside that, most of the program/software is first developed for Linux Distribution because of their widespread use.

# Installation

### Ubuntu Only

[Install Ubuntu desktop | Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop?fbclid=IwAR3TUtu5aaPzHvAgq-ajwFWwQMvioIHcv8ZpKaxusvlIcnFgatW6t6uiPA8#1-overview)

NOTE: Take precaution before choosing “Erase disk and Install Ubuntu”. It’ll replace your pre-installed OS with the new Ubuntu. Refer this tutorial for partitioning

### Dual Boot

### More Flavours

Linux won't limit you like macOS or Windows where you have to wait for the owner companies to release new features and add new things to the appearance or functionality. You can try out other Linux Distros too if you are feeling to try something new something different.

- Zorin OS - Appearance
- Pop OS - Performance
- Kali Linux - Toolbox
- Deepin OS - Appearance ( Chinese )
- Elementary OS - Apple People

## Windows Subsystem for Linux

Although not the recommended way to go about for any programmer, Windows finally had to support Ubuntu within its very system for programmers, which is known as WSL. WSL is a wrapper for Ubuntu presented to you in your old and clanky Windows 10 :P.

Sooner or later you will have to switch to Linux for Software Development purposes. But if you are a bit afraid of damaging your system during installation you can check out the following WSL resources.

**Note** you won't be shown your password as you type it in for the first time so make sure you don't type in something random as you will need that password.

## Commands

The command line is a very powerful tool that you must master to be a good developer.

Here is a video to start.

# Assignment

Finally, we’ve reached on to give you your first assignment! A Bandit challenge where you can practice all the shell commands you’ve learnt so far:

You have a whole week so complete at least 15 levels and finally, store all the passwords in a file. You’ll get a really good practice in using shell and how you can use different commands.
