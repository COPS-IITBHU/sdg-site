## Using Mongodb Database with express

Express provides support for using both Relational and NoSQL databases. Relation databases are generally derivative of SQL family data bases where one has to define different tables and relations between them for storing data. NoSQL databases do not use the traditional tables and relation format for storing data. Hence this becomes handy as developers get the freedom to store the data just in format it is used in their application. So, we will be using Mongodb a famous rival of SQL database family.

This tutorial from MDN will help you get started with using Mongodb:

Although freedom to store data just as it is used in application is helpful. It can also make life of developers terrible if there is no standard definitions about what is the format of data being stored. One cannot imagine using a data without knowing what it contains. So it becomes necessary to define some formal definitions (schema) and relations so that data can be used efficiently in the application. To help with this task another javascript framework **Mongoose** comes to rescue. There is no better way to learn using Mongoose than going through its documentation.

[Mongoose v5.13.2: Schemas](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guides.html)

Populating relations in mongoose models:

## User Authentication System

Creating a backend without user login and authentication is incomplete. A user authentication system makes the app personalized for users. It takes the web app to altogether another level. There are several ways for authentication when working with `Express.js`. In you task we are using `passport` framework.

Here you can learn more about it

## Testing the API

Well anything untested is never reliable. We provide you resources for setting up applications that can help you with testing the APIs you made. You can choose anyone or both and learn more about them through resources we have attached or through whatever sources of you choice.
