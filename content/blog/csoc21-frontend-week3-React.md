# React JS

[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications by dividing the UI into composable elements. It was originally developed as an in-house library for Facebook, and then it was later open-sourced in 2013.

To know more about React and what it offers, go through the following article

[React JS: What and Why?](https://harsh-patel.medium.com/react-js-what-and-why-e6cad2dfb4c3)

## Fundamentals of React JS

---

### React is all about components

React is designed around the concept of reusable components. You define small components and you put them together to form bigger components.

All components small or big are reusable, even across different projects

There are two types of components Functional Components and Class Components each of one having their own pros and cons

Here is a video explaining the difference between them

or you can read the following article

[React Functional Components VS Class Components](https://medium.com/wesionary-team/react-functional-components-vs-class-components-86a2d2821a22)

### What the flux is JSX?

[JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is a JavaScript Extension Syntax used in React to easily write HTML and JavaScript together.

It allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any¬†`createElement()`¬† and/or¬†`appendChild()`¬†methods.

You can refer to the following tutorial for understanding the concept of JSX

[Understanding the Basics of using JSX with React](https://medium.com/@latoyazamill/understanding-the-basics-of-using-jsx-with-react-7d5d78174d4b)

### Styling in React.js

React allow you to include CSS in his components in several ways

The following articles gives you an overview of styling in React and we can implement them

Different ways to implement CSS

For scoping CSS/SCSS in React JS

[ü¶Ñ How to scope your CSS/SCSS in React JS ‚ö°Ô∏è](https://dev.to/viclafouch/how-to-scope-your-css-scss-in-react-js-271a)

### Hooks

[Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are basically functions that let us include react state and lifecycle features without using Classes, and organize the logic inside a component into reusable, isolated units. They were introduced in 2018 (available from v16.8.0).

# Next JS

Before diving into Next JS you need to know about **Client-Side Rendering(CSR)** and **Server-Side** **Rendering (SSR)**

This article will help you in doing so

[Client-side vs. server-side rendering: why it's not all black and white](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-exactly-is-client-side-rendering-and-hows-it-different-from-server-side-rendering-bd5c786b340d/)

Ever since the enormous spike in popularity of highly dynamic front-end frameworks such as React, web developers have been trying to find a balance between the interactive user experience offered by client-side rendering, and the various speed and optimization related benefits provided by server-side data rendering.

One easy way of combining these techniques to get the best of both worlds is by using [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/), a simple and flexible framework built on top of React, which allows users to utilize a wide range of features like server-side rendering, static site generation, easy file-based routing and much more! 

To know more about Next JS, you can read this tutorial

[Introduction to Server Side Rendering with Next.js](https://medium.com/spidernitt/introduction-to-server-side-rendering-with-next-js-d7b046d121c8)
