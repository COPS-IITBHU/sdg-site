# CSoC'21 Dev Backend

Welcome to CSoC'21 Dev! Here's all the backend resources and tasks you need to know, complete, and focus on for every week.

For frontend resources you should refer [CSoC'21 Dev Frontend](csoc21-frontend).

# Heads up!

All the great learning resources of COPS Dev group can also be found at [COPS Dev Resources](https://copsiitbhu.co.in/resources/dev/).

# Week 4

After completing the third task now you would be comfortable with APIs and GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE requests. But now you would want to know how the back end server was made. So, let's change our gears and head on towards learning some back-end stuff.

This week you will learn about two most popular backend frameworks **Django** and **Express,** both these framework are known for high customizability. For completing this task you obviously need some knowledge of frontend.

**Pre-requisites:** [Week-1 (Web development)](csoc21-frontend-week1-Web-Development)

You may choose to compete in any number of tracks.

#### Topics for Week 4

1. [Django](csoc21-backend-week4-Django)
2. [Express](csoc21-backend-week4-Express)


# Week 5

Now that you have completed the CSOC Backend Assignment, you built your own web app backed with Django/Express as the backend. Overnight your web app became a star success!! Congrats! They love it so much, that they want a mobile phone version! Time to create an Android Version! And an iOS version...

And then you have to replicate 2 times the same backend code to Add, View, Remove, Update and Delete data, with different languages.

That opens the door to many possible mistakesâ€¦ And that is where rest APIs shines out.....

Djnago Rest Framework (DRF) and Express enable you to host the same backend for web, mobile and desktop applications.

Needless to say, we have so lovingly prepared an assignment for you that will make you "REST-less" (pun intended :)) 

You may choose to compete in any number of tracks.

#### Topics for Week 5

1. [Django](csoc21-backend-week5-Django-REST-Framework)
2. [Express](csoc21-backend-week5-Express-REST-Framework)


# Things to keep in mind

### No plagiarism

Plagiarism in any of the tasks isn't allowed and can easily be caught. Learn from others' code but don't copy, otherwise, you're just giving yourself a handicap in learning.
