# Introduction

So After Frontend, we are left with Web Backend to gain a good command over web dev. That is why we bring you here, to Django!

Django is a Loosely Coupled Framework, that uses MVC (Model-View-Controller) core architecture. What is MVC, well that's not important for now.

Here is a brief intro to why we use Django:

[Why We Use Django Framework & What Is Django Best Used For](https://djangostars.com/blog/why-we-use-django-framework/)

Check out the official site:

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

Django likes to call itself _"The Web Framework for Perfectionists with Deadlines"_. Hopefully you'll be able to validate the authenticity of their claim by the end of next week! 😉

### Why was Django made?

The backend developers needed a common interface to be able to work with seemingly different data sources and database software.

The design teams needed to manage the user experience with the tools they already had (HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc.)

The hard-core coders needed a framework that allowed them to rapidly deploy changes within the system that kept everyone happy.

### Features

Django has

- Simple syntax
- Its own web server to test locally
- MVC (Model-View-Controller) core architecture
- Django comes with all the essentials needed for solving common cases
- HTTP libraries;
- Middleware support
- Great community support
- Lots of libraries available to extend the functionality

### Principles

[Design philosophies | Django documentation | Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/misc/design-philosophies/#don-t-repeat-yourself-dry)

Most important principles to remember:

1. **DRY** aka **Don't Repeat Yourself**
2. Loose Coupling
3. Explicit is better than implicit
4. **EAFP** aka **Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission** ([read more](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/idiomatic-python-eafp-versus-lbyl/))
5. Efficient SQL Queries

Don't worry, if you do not understand all of the above principles right now. You'll understand and appreciate them as you work more with the framework.

Being just introduced to Django, it would be of help to get tips from time tested users of Django.

## User Authentication System

Creating a backend without user login and authentication is incomplete. A user authentication system makes the app personalised for users. It takes the web app to altogether another level. Django has a built in authentication system,getting your work done with almost no effort, giving you most of the joy.
